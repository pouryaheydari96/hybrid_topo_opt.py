Hybrid Topology Optimization combining U-Net for rapid initial design and SIMP-FEM for final, high-fidelity structural refinement. Solves MBB, Cantilever, and Bridge problems.
Hybrid Topology Optimization ProjectThis project implements a two-stage hybrid framework for structural topology optimization, combining the speed of Machine Learning (ML) for initial synthesis with the accuracy of classical Finite Element Method (FEM) and Optimality Criteria (OC) for final refinement.🎯 Key FeaturesML-Driven Initial Design: Uses an Enhanced U-Net architecture to predict high-quality initial density fields rapidly, significantly accelerating the optimization process.Classical Refinement: Employs the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method with Optimality Criteria (OC) to refine the ML output, ensuring structural validity, volume constraint satisfaction, and maximum stiffness (minimum compliance).Problem Variety: Configured to solve standard 2D topology optimization benchmarks: MBB-Beam, Cantilever Beam, and Bridge problems.Built-in Data Generation: Includes a pipeline to generate training data by running the classical SIMP solver on randomized initial designs.⚙️ Technical DetailsComponentTechnology / MethodDescriptionOptimization MethodHybrid (ML + Classical)ML for initialization, SIMP/OC for constraint satisfaction and convergence.ML ModelEnhanced U-NetUsed for image-to-image translation (initial input to optimized density map).Loss FunctionCombined BCE and Dice LossOptimizes for both pixel-wise accuracy and shape overlap.Classical SolverPython + SciPy (Sparse Matrix)2D Plane Stress FEM for displacement, OC for density update, Density Filter for stability.Material ModelSIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization)$E(x) = E_{min} + x^p (E_0 - E_{min})$ (with $p=3.0$ by default).EnvironmentPyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, MatplotlibPrimary libraries used for ML and Numerical Analysis.🚀 Usage (Quick Start)The code is designed to run the full experiment automatically, covering data generation, ML training, hybrid optimization, and final analysis for all three problem types (MBB, Cantilever, Bridge).
